This was my first time creating web browswer extension so it was challenging. I had no prior knowledge of front end programming language 
such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to connect those componenet to interact one another. I ended up spending majority of my time 
on learning the basics and multiple google search to find out what I should do. I am still trying to learn the basics of those languages
and hopefully I'll be able to contribute to some extent.

Our group communicated through facebook and we worked on the code online. We were not skilled in github so we used facebook message 
to make all decision before uploading in gitub. Most of the code were written by by teammates so I tried to help with the basic layout
of the project. I tried to work with css for background but I failed to make it work so I left it as separate branch to work on it. 
I hope we could use more of github to communicate and decision making as we get comfortable with it. My teammates were responsive and 
actively sharing idea.
