During NYC open data week I went to one of the event called Bigapps blockchain at St. Francis College. It was a 2 hour seminar about
the basics of block chain by an employee who works on the field from UK. She walked us through the concept and the usability of blockchain
in real life and the potential it has as a way to manage data, such as voting procedure or saving conficential governemnt data. 
She seemed to be interested in mering blockchain with government work. After that we were told about the nyc open data and how nyu uses 
data to better our lives, showing how data is used to manage the city: traffic, population, etc. They tried to make us play a telephone game?
but most of the people left at that point.
