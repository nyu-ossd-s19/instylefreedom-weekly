So I decided to look on openMRS. I do realized this was on the list of open soure program activity we did on Wednesday, but there weren't enough people interested to look into it. But I was really interested in the program so I decided to evaluate this project. (Hope it's not a problem) Eversince I was a child, I had interest in helping people. I found joy in helping people and seeing a smile on their face. Their happiness filled my heart will warmth. So I wanted to see if there was a open source project that is dedicated to help others and openMRS seems to be the perfect project for me. This is the reason why I chose the project.
